# Building a Power BI Dashboard for Car Listings Analysis



## Business Requirements
The Australian car market is highly competitive, and the management team of an automotive company seeks insights from their current inventory to optimize pricing strategies, improve inventory management, and understand market trends. As a BI analyst, my task is to analyze the dataset of car listings and build an interactive Power BI dashboard to support business decisions.

 ## understanding:

##### -The most popular car brands and models in their inventory.
##### -How prices vary across different car brands, fuel types, and gearbox types.
##### -The distribution of car models by year and the impact of the market age of cars on pricing.
##### -The number of cars listed as new versus used, along with the price differences between these categories.
##### -Trends in mileage and engine capacity across different car types.
##### -How various car attributes such as color, design type, and seating capacity impact car desirability and pricing.

This analysis will help the automotive company:

##### -Optimize pricing strategies based on car features and conditions.
##### -Manage inventory efficiently by identifying popular or slow-moving car types.
##### -Understand market trends in terms of fuel type, gearbox preferences, and car age.
##### -Enhance customer targeting strategies based on car features and preferences.
